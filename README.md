## Scenario
Consider the following scenario: we have a database dump that needs to be restored while the container is being built. After the container has been constructed, we may use 'source' to restore a database. But what if it's needed in the middle of the game?

## Prerequisites
 - Knowledge of Docker
 - Docker installed

## Solution
The usage of mounting makes it simple to restore a database dump. Here we have a dump of the database named "wpdb.sql". It's a dump of one wordpress database.

```sh
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-37-71 newsite]$ pwd
/home/ec2-user/newsite
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-37-71 newsite]$ du -sch wpdb.sql 
1.4M    wpdb.sql
1.4M    total
```

We have to mount the dump file's path to /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/, So, what exactly is "docker-entrypoint-initdb.d?"

> Initialization scripts If you would like to do additional initialization in an image derived from this one, add one or more *.sql, *.sql.gz, or *.sh scripts under /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d (creating the directory if necessary). After the entrypoint calls initdb to create the default postgres user and database, it will run any *.sql files, run any executable *.sh scripts, and source any non-executable *.sh scripts found in that directory to do further initialization before starting the service.

Also follow thoguh the [offical mysql image doc from docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql) and [volumes doc on docker docs](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) to get a better understanding. 

Now that we got an idea about "docker-entrypoint-initdb.d," let's create a docker container.

```sh
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-37-71 newsite]$ docker container run --name database -p 3306:3306 -d -v /home/ec2-user/newsite/wpdb.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/wpdb.sql -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD="<mysql root password>"  mysql:5.7
```

We can see from the above that we've mounted the .sql file in /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/, and Docker will use this file when building the container.

```sh
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-37-71 newsite]$ docker container ls
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE       COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                                                  NAMES
56d9859af1ac   mysql:5.7   "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   9 seconds ago   Up 8 seconds   0.0.0.0:3306->3306/tcp, :::3306->3306/tcp, 33060/tcp   database
```

Now that we have a working container, we can use the mysql console to see if the database has been restored. We must first use exec to enter the docker container in interactive mode.

```sh
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-37-71 newsite]$ docker container exec -it database bash
root@56d9859af1ac:/# mysql -u root -p
Enter password:

Take a look at what we've got! Hooray!! The wpdb.sql database dump was restored to the 'wp' database. If you learned something from my blog, please remember to share it  ðŸŒŸ and if you REALLY enjoyed it, please follow me!
